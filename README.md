# Photo-Diary-App

This Photo Diary App provides a simple and intuitive interface for logging your memories. You can upload photos (or use your device's camera), add descriptive captions and relevant tags, and even select an emoji to capture the mood of the moment. All your entries are saved locally in your browser and displayed in a clean, responsive grid. The search bar allows you to quickly find specific photos by caption, tags, or date.

Key Features Implemented:

Photo Input: Uses a file input that supports both file uploads and camera capture on mobile devices.

Caption & Tags: Text fields for adding context to your photos.

Mood/Emotion Emoji Picker: A selection of emojis to associate with each photo.

Local Storage: All photo data (including the image as a Base64 string) is saved in your browser's local storage, so your diary persists even after closing the tab.

Dynamic Gallery: Photos are displayed in a responsive grid, adapting to different screen sizes.

Search Functionality: Filter photos by caption, tags, or date.

Delete Functionality: Each photo card has a delete button with a confirmation modal.

Responsive Design: Styled with Tailwind CSS to look good on both desktop and mobile devices.
